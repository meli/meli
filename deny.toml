# cargo-deny configuration

[graph]
# When creating the dependency graph used as the source of truth when checks are
# executed, this field can be used to prune crates from the graph, removing them
# from the view of cargo-deny. This is an extremely heavy hammer, as if a crate
# is pruned from the graph, all of its dependencies will also be pruned unless
# they are connected to another crate in the graph that hasn't been pruned,
# so it should be used with care. The identifiers are [Package ID Specifications]
# (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/pkgid-spec.html)

# If true, metadata will be collected with `--all-features`. Note that this can't
# be toggled off if true, if you want to conditionally enable `--all-features` it
# is recommended to pass `--all-features` on the cmd line instead
all-features = false
# If true, metadata will be collected with `--no-default-features`. The same
# caveat with `all-features` applies
no-default-features = false
# If set, these feature will be enabled when collecting metadata. If `--features`
# is specified on the cmd line they will take precedence over this option.
